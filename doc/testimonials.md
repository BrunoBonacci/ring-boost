Here comments from users who tried ring-boost.

## [Shryne](http://www.shryne.com) / Mario Altimari CTO

We used *ring-boost 0.1.0* to accelerate the performance of services which compute complex, slow changing, values and we dramatically improved latencies and resource usage. 
These services were under heavy load because constantly used. With *ring-boost*, we went from an average of 7.4 sec (due to the heavy load on I/O and CPU) to a median response time of **0.035** sec and much lower CPU footprint.
